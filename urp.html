        <h1>What can I do to be part of the solution?</h1>
        <p>
                Begin to discard electronic waste in a responsible way. It is no longer acceptable to leave electronic hardware on the nature strip for garbage collection. Recycling companies can be contacted to collect various types of e-waste that need to be removed and recycled, and there are organisations where you can drop off your e-waste without 
                charge. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Initial steps include: 
        <ul>
                <li>
                avoid purchasing new electronic products that cannot be reused and recycled by the manufacturer
                </li>
                <li>
        	reduce your consumption of electronic devices, and repair broken equipment before purchasing new items.
                </li>
	        <li>
                reuse your electronic devices by donating items to charity, friends or family
                </li>
	        <li>
                recycle your electronic devices instead of sending them to landfill
                </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Computers and televisions</h1>
        <p>
                While the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme is being rolled out and more collection and 
                recycle drop-off points are announced, here are some suggestions for what you can do with computers and 
                televisions that you no longer need:
        <ul>
                <li>
                if they are still in good working order, ask a charity, school or secondhand store if they will take them
                </li>
	        <li>
                pass them on to friends or family
                </li>
                <li>
	        contact your local council for more 
                information on their recycling services 
                </li>
                <li>
                store electronic equipment out of the weather until access to the scheme is available in your area.
                </li>
                <li>
                approach a company that will refurbish your old computer equipment for use by those who cannot afford new items.
                </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Mobile phones</h1>
        <p>
                Mobile phones are constructed out of numerous non-renewable materials such as plastics, metals, ceramics 
                and glass, and the contents vary from model to model. As mobile phone technology continuously advances, 
                the materials can change; there is no exact formula or single list of the substances used for mobile phones.<br><br>
                However, around 90% of these non-renewable materials can be recycled and reused. The official recycling 
                program of the mobile phone industry is run by MobileMuster. It is a voluntary recycling program that collects 
                and recycles mobile phone handsets, batteries, chargers and accessories. There are drop-off points across 
                India located at mobile phone retailers, local councils, government agents and business.<br><br>

                MobileMuster ensures that all components of the mobile phones are recycled to the highest environmental 
                standards and that none is refurbished or resold in developing countries<br><br>
                Many mobile phone parts can be recycled and reused:
        <ul>
                <li>
        	batteries include nickel, cobalt and cadmium, which can be used to make stainless steel and new batteries.
                </li>
                <li>
	        circuit boards include small amounts of gold and silver that can be used in jewellery and other applications.
                </li>
                <li>
        	handset casings include plastics that can be reused to make fence posts and pallets.
                </li>
                <li>
	        plastics and metals found in mobile phone accessories can be shredded, sorted and used to make new plastic or metal products.
                </li>
        </ul>
                But remember, prior to handing in your mobile device for recycling, ensure that all sensitive data have been removed!<br>
                Mobile phones contain highly toxic elements, including cadmium, arsenic, lead and mercury. It is important 
                that our old mobile phones do not end up in landfill.
        <code>
                Fact: There are over 22 million unwanted mobile phones hidden away in drawers, cupboards 
                and garages across India, the equivalent of 2200 tonnes of metal, minerals, plastic and glass. 
                These are all materials that could be recycled and reused!

                Large electronic office equipment, such as printers and photocopiers, can be collected or dropped off 
                at recycling plants. Some recycling companies will come and pick up equipment for a fee. They will then remove and recycle ferrous and non-ferrous materials.

	        Use Cartridges 4 Planet Ark, a national       program, to recycle your printer    cartridges. Don’t throw them in the garbage bin!
                </li>

        <h1>How to securely remove data before disposing of e-waste</h1>
        <p>
                Before any of your electronic equipment can be recycled or donated from general practice, it is important to 
                remove all data from the device. Data can be related to personal details of patients or information about the business of your practice. <br>
                Failure to remove data from these electronic devices, particularly sensitive information, breaches patient information privacy and security.<br>
                If electronic media such as hard drives, USB flash drives, CDs and DVDs are not properly erased, patient data and general business data may be used for many purposes, such as appropriating and creating bank accounts and loans, or purchasing medicines and medical insurance.<br>
                Patient-identifiable information can be a prime target for identity theft.<br>
                Sold and donated computers have been found in secondary markets, such as auctions, still containing personal information.<br>
                This data can be more valuable than the electronic equipment it is stored on. Further, it can be relatively easy for those who are technically capable to recover such information from any electronic media.

        <h1>Don’t just delete files</h1>
        <p>
                It is not sufficient to delete files and documents on your computer, or to drag and drop files into the recycle bin. The data after deletion still reside on the hard drive even though you cannot access them directly. It is very important to take further measures to ensure this data are securely erased.

        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h1>How to recycle storage devices</h1>
        <p>
                Before these items are sent to be recycled, ensure all sensitive data are removed to maintain data security. <br>
                Data can easily be deleted from CDs and DVDs; these data are non-recoverable. <br>
                CDs, DVDs, USB flash drives and external hard drives are all used as data storage devices. Disks are often 
                discarded into bins when the data are no longer required; however, it is important to remember that CDs and DVDs are non-biodegradable products that contain toxic chemicals and metals. These toxins can 
                contaminate the environment if they end up in landfill. 
                CDs and DVDs can be recycled to reuse up to 98% of the original disk, including the polycarbonate 
                (plastic) materials and aluminium found within these items.

        <p>
                Before recycling your mobile phone, make sure any sensitive information saved onto the phone memory is 
                erased. While the subscriber identification module (SIM) card can be transferred from your old to your new 
                updated mobile phone, information stored on these cards can also be simply deleted if no longer required. 
                Information on how to remove data from your mobile phone can be found on the handset manufacturer’s website.
