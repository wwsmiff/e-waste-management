        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><hl1>EFFECTS OF E-WASTE</hl1></h1>
        <br><br>
        <div>
                <p>
                The <hl2>consequences</hl2> of improper <hl2>e-waste</hl2> disposal in <hl2>landfills</hl2> or other non-dumping sites pose serious threats to current public health and can pollute ecosystems for <hl2>generations</hl2> to come. When electronics are <hl2>improperly</hl2> disposed of and end up in <hl2>landfills</hl2>, toxic chemicals are released, impacting the earth’s air, soil, water and ultimately, <hl2>human health</hl2>.
                </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h1><hl1>The Negative Effects on Air</hl1></h1>
        <p>
                <hl2>Contamination</hl2> in the air occurs when <hl2>e-waste</hl2> is informally disposed by dismantling, shredding or <hl2>melting</hl2> the materials, releasing dust particles or toxins, such as dioxins, into the <hl2>environment</hl2> that cause air pollution and damage respiratory health. E-waste of little value is often burned, but burning also serves a way to get valuable metal from <hl2>electronics</hl2>, like copper. Chronic diseases and cancers are at a higher risk to occur when burning e-waste because it also releases fine particles, which can travel thousands of miles, creating numerous <hl2>negative health</hl2> risks to <hl2>humans and animals</hl2>. Higher value materials, such as gold and silver, are often removed from highly integrated <hl2>electronics</hl2> by using acids, desoldering, and other chemicals, which also release fumes in areas where recycling is not <hl2>regulated</hl2> properly. The negative effects on air from informal e-waste recycling are most dangerous for those who handle this waste, but the <hl2>pollution can extend thousands of miles away from recycling sites</hl2>. <br><br>
                The <hl2>air pollution</hl2> caused by e-waste impacts some <hl2>animal species</hl2> more than others, which may be <hl2>endangering</hl2> these species and the <hl2>biodiversity</hl2> of certain regions that are <hl2>chronically polluted</hl2>. Over time, <hl2>air pollution</hl2> can hurt water quality, soil and plant species, creating irreversible damage in ecosystems. For instance, an informal recycling hub in Guiyu, China that was formed by parties <hl2>interested in extracting</hl2> valuable metals from e-waste, and subsequently has caused the region to have <hl2>extremely high</hl2> lead levels in the air, which are inhaled and then ingested when returned to water and soil. This can cause <hl2>disproportionate neurological</hl2> damage to larger animals, wildlife and humans in the area.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <br>
        <div>
        <h1><hl1>The Negative Effects on Soil</hl1></h1>
        <p>
                When <hl2>improper disposal</hl2> of e-waste in regular landfills or in places where it is dumped <hl2>illegally</hl2>, both heavy metals and flame retardants can seep directly from the e-waste into the soil, causing <hl2>contamination</hl2> of underlying <hl2>groundwater</hl2> or contamination of crops that may be planted near by or in the area in the future. When the soil is contaminated by heavy metals, the crops become vulnerable to a<hl2>bsorbing</hl2> these toxins, which can cause many <hl2>illnesses</hl2> and doesn’t allow the <hl2>farmland</hl2> to be as productive as possible.<br><br>
                When large <hl2>particles are released</hl2> from burning, shredding or dismantling e-waste, they quickly re-deposit to the ground and contaminate the soil as well, due to their size and weight. The amount of soil <hl2>contaminated</hl2> depends on a range of factors including temperature, soil type, pH levels and soil <hl2>composition</hl2>. These pollutants can remain in the soil for a long period of time and can be harmful to <hl2>microorganisms</hl2> in the soil and plants. Ultimately, animals and wildlife relying on nature for <hl2>survival</hl2> will end up consuming affected plants, causing internal health problems.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <br>
        <div>
        <h1><hl1>The Negative Effects on Water</hl1></h1>
        <p>
                After soil <hl2>contamination</hl2>, heavy metals from e-waste, such as mercury, lithium, lead and barium, then leak through the earth even further to reach <hl2>groundwater</hl2>. When these <hl2>heavy metals</hl2> reach groundwater, they <hl2>eventually</hl2> make their way into ponds, streams, rivers and lakes. Through these <hl2>pathways</hl2>, <hl2>acidification</hl2> and <hl2>toxification</hl2> are created in the water, which is unsafe for animals, plants and <hl2>communities</hl2> even if they are miles away from a <hl2>recycling</hl2> site. Clean drinking water becomes problematic to find.<br><br>
                <hl2>Acidification</hl2> can kill marine and <hl2>freshwater</hl2> organisms, disturb <hl2>biodiversity</hl2> and harm <hl2>ecosystems</hl2>. If acidification is present in water supplies, it can damage ecosystems to the point where recovery is <hl2>questionable</hl2>, if not impossible.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <br>
        <div>
        <h1><hl1>The Negative Effects on Humans</hl1></h1>
        <p>
                As mentioned, <hl2>electronic</hl2> waste contains toxic <hl2>components</hl2> that are dangerous to <hl2>human health</hl2>, such as mercury, lead, cadmium, polybrominated flame retardants, barium and lithium. The <hl2>negative</hl2> health effects of these <hl2>toxins</hl2> on humans include brain, heart, liver, kidney and skeletal system damage. It can also considerably affect the nervous and reproductive systems of the human body, leading to <hl2>disease</hl2> and birth defects. Improper disposal of e-waste is <hl2>unbelievably</hl2> dangerous to the global environment, which is why it is so important to spread awareness on this growing problem and the <hl2>threatening aftermath</hl2>. To avoid these toxic effects of e-waste, it is crucial to properly e-cycle, so that items can be recycled, <hl2>refurbished</hl2>, resold, or reused. The growing stream of e-waste will only worsen if not <hl2>educated</hl2> on the correct <hl2>measures</hl2> of disposal.<br>
