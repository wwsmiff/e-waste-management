        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><hl1>E-WASTE SOLUTIONS</hl1></h1><br><br>
        <div>
        <p>
                The good news is that there are <hl2>efficient and successful</hl2> ways to solve the growing environmental problems that <hl2>e-waste poses.</hl2>  And one of the most proven solutions is through recycling and reusing.
        </p>
        <p>
                If we can make it part of their <hl2>weekly</hl2> routine to recycle plastics, cans, and newspapers, why not a used smartphone or laptop as well?
        </p>
        <p>
                Avoid the <hl2>health and environmental</hl2> hazards <hl2>caused by e-waste</hl2>. Reduce new purchases, reuse, repair, and recycle unused <hl2>electronic gadgets and equipment</hl2>. E-waste does not need to be wasted. There are many other uses which we will discuss below.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h1></hl1>Steps to avoid these hazards</hl1></h1> 
        <h3><hl1>Reduce</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                The first line of <hl2>defense in minimizing</hl2> e-waste is to reduce purchases of new electronic devices and electrical equipment. <hl2>Think twice</hl2> before buying a new <hl2>electronic gadget</hl2> when an upgrade or new device becomes available. Not buying new stuff is good for the <hl2>environment</hl2> and your wallet. You can use the same device without having to buy a new device.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h3><hl1>Reuse</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                Another way to reduce e-waste is to <hl2>redeploy existing items</hl2> to new owners. How many <hl2>people have an old cell</hl2> phone or laptop stashed as a backup that never gets used? <hl2>Pre-owned</hl2> electronic <hl2>devices</hl2> can be put to good use by other people.
        </p>
        <p>
                Regift Computer to a friend or family member<br>
                <hl2>Donate</hl2> to a school, community center, nonprofit, Salvation Army, Goodwill, or charitable organization.<br>
                Sell or <hl2>giveaway</hl2> using services like Gazelle or Freecycle.<br>
                Keep in mind the person or <hl2>organization</hl2> you give, donate, or sell your used <hl2>electronic devices</hl2> to may or may not recycle them properly down the road.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h3><hl1>Repair</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                When <hl2>electronic devices</hl2> and electrical equipment break down, they can often be <hl2>repaired.</hl2> People may choose to toss out the old unit and buy a new replacement <hl2>because</hl2> it seems cheaper and less hassle.
        </p>
        <p>
                When one <hl2>considers</hl2> that retail prices do not include the cost of <hl2>environmental damage</hl2> and health issues caused by dumping <hl2>e-waste</hl2> in landfills or recycling it unsafely. So before buying next <hl2>time please</hl2> start considering the <hl2>environmental</hl2> damage.
        </p>
        <p>
                It may <hl2>require</hl2> a little extra effort to repair an item or have it repaired. There is a <hl2>growing movement</hl2> for do-it-yourself electronic gadget repair which is good for the <hl2>environment</hl2>, empowers people, and often saves money.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h3><hl1>Recycle / E-Cycle</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                <hl2>E-waste contains</hl2> valuable materials as well as <hl2>potentially</hl2> toxic substances and can be safely recycled to recover <hl2>metals</hl2> and other materials for reuse and dispose of toxins appropriately.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h3><hl1>Education</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                The second most important solution is to <hl2>educate people</hl2> about how important recycling is for e-waste. It can begin with setting an example. Make a <hl2>commitment</hl2> on your own to take any electronic device you have that’s no longer wanted or being used, and bring it to a <hl2>recycling</hl2> firm rather than throw it out with your regular trash or tossing it in a desk drawer.
        </p>
        <p>
                But then it’s also important to be vocal about that with others. They should note that you adopted the practice of <hl2>recycling</hl2> each device out of concern for our environment.
        </p>
        <p>
                Start spreading the word by writing about the <hl2>environmental benefits</hl2> of e-waste on social media to spread awareness around the world.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h3><hl1>Teach</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                It’s important to spread that message to your family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers, but it’s also important to get the message to our <hl2>future leaders</hl2> — our children.
        </p>
        <p>
                You could start by asking your teacher if you could work on a project to have all the kids at school bring in the old cell phones their parents no longer want, and teach the students how to collect the devices and get them to a <hl2>recycling firm.</hl2>
        </p>
        <p>
                And it isn’t just schools that have a role to play here. <hl2>Non-profit organizations, municipal governments and businesses in the private sector</hl2> can also get involved in hosting community events that promote recycling and educating people about our e-waste challenge and effects on our environment.
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div>
        <h3><hl1>Keep Learning</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                Just as the <hl2>technology</hl2> that creates smartphones and other devices keeps changing, the same is true when it comes to e-waste. In the U.S., 25 states now have laws that aim to either prevent used electronics from being sent to landfills, or that promote recycling. The <hl2>European Union</hl2> has established new goals for increasing e-waste recycling rates. The United Nations has launched the Step-Initiative to introduce a <hl2>comprehensive approach</hl2> to handling E-Waste, while also preparing professionals to work in the field of E-Waste management. We could bring these ideas to India as we are the country with high rates of E-waste. 
        </p>
        <p>
                The bottom line is a lot of actions are now being taken to provide <hl2>practical solutions</hl2> to e-waste problems — solutions that address environmental and health concerns, while at the same time <hl2>emphasizing other issues.</hl2>
        </p>

        <h3><hl1    >Electronic Recycling Collection</hl1></h3>
        <p>
                Annually, <hl2>computer devices</hl2> account for nearly 70% of e-waste, 12% comes from the telecom sector, 8% from medical equipment and 7% from <hl2>electric equipment</hl2>. The government, public sector companies, and private sector companies generate nearly 75% of electronic waste, with the contribution of individual <hl2>household</hl2> being only 16%
                E-Waste Dropped Off During Earth Day Event Recycle Cities or organizations may offer periodic <hl2>e-cycling</hl2> events where people can drop off their used electronics. Sports teams <hl2>promote electronic</hl2> recycling by allowing fans to drop off their e-waste at the venue and then enjoy the game.
        </p>
        <p>
                Some <hl2>manufacturers</hl2> and retailers offer drop-off or mail-in take back programs.
        </p>
        <p>
                Below are a few of the many websites that help people find <hl2>places to recycle</hl2> their unwanted electronics. Look for electronic recyclers <hl2>that are e-Stewards</hl2> or R2 certified.

        <p>
                Before donating, passing on, or recycling a cell phone, smartphone, tablet, computer, data storage device, etc. make sure your <hl2>personal information is removed.</hl2> Mobile device procedures vary by manufacturer. Deleting files, reformatting, or restoring the operating system to factory settings is <hl2>not sufficient for PCs and Macs.</hl2> Use a <hl2>disk-wiping program</hl2> to make sure all data is deleted and cannot be retrieved.
